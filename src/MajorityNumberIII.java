/**
 * Created by pmg on 2015/11/26.
 *
 * Given an array of integers and a number k, the majority number is the number that occurs more than 1/k of the size of the array.
 * Find it.
 *
 * Example
 * Given [3,1,2,3,2,3,3,4,4,4] and k=3, return 3.
 *
 * Note
 * There is only one majority number in the array.
 *
 * Challenge
 * O(n) time and O(k) extra space
